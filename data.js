    "01_Justinian.mp3": [{ text: "Justinian was the powerful Emperor of the great Byzantine Empire. His wife, Theodora, was an actress and a dancer before she became the Empress. Many rich people in the city did not like her because she was not born into a noble family. But Justinian loved her deeply and trusted her smart mind. One day, the angry people of the city started a big, violent riot. They burned buildings and wanted to kill the Emperor. They wanted a new leader. Justinian was very afraid for his life. His top generals told him, 'We must run away right now to stay safe! The ships are ready.' But Theodora was very brave. She looked at her husband and said, 'No. I will not run away. I am the Empress, and I will die as an Empress. Purple makes a fine shroud.' Her strong and brave words changed everything. They made Justinian feel strong too. He decided to stay in the city. He sent his powerful army to fight the angry mob and stop the riot. Because of Theodora's great courage, Justinian defeated his enemies, kept his throne, and saved his entire empire from destruction.",

    "02_Tiberius.mp3": [{ text: "Emperor Tiberius was a strong Roman leader. His best friend was General Marcus. They grew up together and shared many great military victories. However, Marcus made a terrible mistake. He started a secret, dangerous romance with the Emperor's wife, the Empress. When Emperor Tiberius finally discovered this hidden affair, he was deeply hurt and angry. Marcus completely betrayed his trust. Because they were old childhood friends, the Emperor gave Marcus one final choice instead of a simple execution. He put the brave general in a large sand arena with two heavy wooden doors. Behind the first door was a fierce, hungry tiger. Behind the second door was a beautiful lady and enough gold to start a new life in another land. The Empress watched the quiet trial from a high stone balcony. Marcus looked up at her. He truly hoped she would save his life today. The Empress slowly pointed her finger to the door on the right. Marcus trusted her completely. He walked over and opened it. Immediately, the hungry tiger jumped out and killed him in the arena. Marcus paid the price for his betrayal. She preferred her lover dead than living a happy life with another woman.",
