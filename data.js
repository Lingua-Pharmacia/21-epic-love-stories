He was a great, strong soldier and he absolutely loved to fight in foreign wars. He needed a lot of money and a strong political friend for a huge, important religious war called a Crusade. So, he agreed to legally marry a princess named Berengaria. It was just a smart business deal, not a real, warm love story at all. They got married very quickly on a sunny island while they were traveling to the big war. Immediately after the short wedding, Richard went away to fight with his heavy sword. Berengaria went to live quietly in another country. They almost never saw each other again. Richard was always fiercely fighting battles or sitting in a dark prison. Berengaria officially held the high title of the Queen of England, but she never even visited the actual country of England while Richard was the King. It was a very strange, cold marriage built completely on military strategy and political power, showing that kings often chose war and glory over real romance and a happy family life.",
