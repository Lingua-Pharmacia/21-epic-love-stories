Many rich people in the city did not like her because she was not born into a noble family. But Justinian loved her deeply and trusted her smart mind. One day, the angry people of the city started a big, violent riot. They burned buildings and wanted to kill the Emperor. They wanted a new leader. Justinian was very afraid for his life. His top generals told him, 'We must run away right now to stay safe! The ships are ready.' But Theodora was very brave. She looked at her husband and said, 'No. I will not run away. I am the Empress, and I will die as an Empress. Purple makes a fine shroud.' Her strong and brave words changed everything. They made Justinian feel strong too. He decided to stay in the city. He sent his powerful army to fight the angry mob and stop the riot. Because of Theodora's great courage, Justinian defeated his enemies, kept his throne, and saved his entire empire from destruction.",

When Emperor Tiberius finally discovered this hidden affair, he was deeply hurt and angry. Marcus completely betrayed his trust. Because they were old childhood friends, the Emperor gave Marcus one final choice instead of a simple execution. He put the brave general in a large sand arena with two heavy wooden doors.

The Empress watched the quiet trial from a high stone balcony. Marcus looked up at her. He truly hoped she would save his life today. The Empress slowly pointed her finger to the door on the right. Marcus trusted her completely. He walked over and opened it. Immediately, the hungry tiger jumped out and killed him in the arena. Marcus paid the price for his betrayal.

Then, he met a smart, incredibly interesting woman named Anne Boleyn. Henry fell completely, madly in love with her. He wanted to marry her immediately, but the powerful Pope in Rome said no. The Pope clearly said Henry could not leave his first wife. Henry was so intensely angry that he completely changed the religion of his entire country. He boldly started his very own English church just so he could formally marry Anne. She finally became his new Queen. But sadly, she did not give him the living baby boy he wanted so badly. She only had a small girl. Henry quickly stopped loving her and became very cold and angry. He listened to bad rumors and said she was a terrible wife and a criminal traitor to the country. He locked her in a dark, cold prison and ordered his men to cut off her head with a sharp sword. It was a very dark, brutal end to a massive, country-changing royal obsession.",
